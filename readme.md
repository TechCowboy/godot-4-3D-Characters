3D Characters Repository</h1>

This repository contains our open-source 3D models, pre-configured and compatible with Godot game engine version 4. The models have been tested and are ready to be used out of the box.

# Installation
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Drag and drop the desired folder(s) from the `models` directory into your project.
3. After Godot imports the character, you can now use it in your project
4. To use the model, you need to instantiate the `model_name_skin.tscn` scene. This is the default scene where the model is set up and where you can call specific methods.
